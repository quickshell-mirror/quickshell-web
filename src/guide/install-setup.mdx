## Installation

Since Quickshell 0.1, you can now choose whether to install by tracking the master branch,
or install by latest release.

### Nix
The Quickshell repo has an embedded flake. You can use either of the two:

- `git+https://git.outfoxxed.me/outfoxxed/quickshell`
- `github:quickshell-mirror/quickshell`

> [!NOTE]
> You can use `?ref=` to specify a tag if you want a tagged release.

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";

    quickshell = {
      # remove ?ref=v0.1.0 to track the master branch
      url = "git+https://git.outfoxxed.me/outfoxxed/quickshell?ref=v0.1.0";

      # THIS IS IMPORTANT
      # Mismatched system dependencies will lead to crashes and other issues.
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
    };
  };
}
```

The package is available as `quickshell.packages.<system>.default`, which can be added to
your `environment.systemPackages` or `home.packages` if you use home-manager.

### Arch
Quickshell is available from the aur under:
- the [quickshell](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/quickshell) package for the latest release
- the [quickshell-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/quickshell-git) package that tracks the master branch

> [!WARNING]
> When using an AUR package, Quickshell may break whenever Qt is updated.
> The AUR gives us no way to actually fix this, but Quickshell will attempt to
> warn you if it detects a breakage when updating. If warned of a breakage,
> please reinstall the package.

Install using the command below:
```sh
yay -S quickshell
# or
yay -S quickshell-git
```
(or your AUR helper of choice)

### Fedora
Quickshell is available from the [errornointernet/quickshell] COPR, as either:
- `quickshell` that tracks the latest release
- `quickshell-git` that tracks the master branch

[errornointernet/quickshell]: https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/errornointernet/quickshell

Install using the command below:
```sh
sudo dnf copr enable errornointernet/quickshell

sudo dnf install quickshell
# or
sudo dnf install quickshell-git
```

### Guix
Quickshell's source repository works as a channel. Add the following to your channel list:

```scheme
(channel
  (name quickshell)
  (url "https://git.outfoxxed.me/outfoxxed/quickshell")
  (branch "master"))
```

Then, you can install the package via `guix install quickshell-git` or by adding `quickshell-git`
to your system or home definition.

You can also clone the repository and use `guix shell -f quickshell.scm` to try out the package.

### Manual build
See [BUILD.md](https://git.outfoxxed.me/quickshell/quickshell/src/branch/master/BUILD.md)
for build instructions and configurations.

## Editor configuration
If you want to write your own configuration, installing a QML grammar and the LSP is recommended.

Read the [Usage Guide](/docs/guide) after configuring your editor.

> [!NOTE]
> Qmlls versions prior to 6.8.2 do not require `-E`

### Emacs
Install the [yuja/tree-sitter-qml](https://github.com/yuja/tree-sitter-qmljs) tree-sitter grammar,
and the [xhcoding/qml-ts-mode](https://github.com/xhcoding/qml-ts-mode) mode.

Both are packaged for nix via [outfoxxed/nix-qml-support](https://git.outfoxxed.me/outfoxxed/nix-qml-support).

Either `lsp-mode` or `eglot` should be usable for LSP ([caveats below](#language-server)).

The author's personal emacs config uses `lsp-mode` and `qml-ts-mode` as follows:
```elisp
(use-package qml-ts-mode
  :after lsp-mode
  :config
  (add-to-list 'lsp-language-id-configuration '(qml-ts-mode . "qml-ts"))
  (lsp-register-client
   (make-lsp-client :new-connection (lsp-stdio-connection '("qmlls", "-E"))
                    :activation-fn (lsp-activate-on "qml-ts")
                    :server-id 'qmlls))
  (add-hook 'qml-ts-mode-hook (lambda ()
                                (setq-local electric-indent-chars '(?\n ?\( ?\) ?{ ?} ?\[ ?\] ?\; ?,))
                                (lsp-deferred))))
```

### Neovim
Neovim has built-in syntax highlighting for QML, however tree-sitter highlighting
may work better than the built-in highlighting. You can install the grammar
using `:TSInstall qmljs`.

To use the language server ([caveats below](#language-server)),
install [nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig)
and the following snippet to your configuration:

```lua
require("lspconfig").qmlls.setup {
  cmd = {"qmlls", "-E"}
}
```

### Helix
Helix has built-in syntax highlighting for QML.

To use the language server, add the following snippet to your configuration:

```toml
[language-server.qmlls]
args = ["-E"]
command = "qmlls"
```

### Vscode
1. Install the [Official QML Support extension]
2. Enable the `qt-qml.qmlls.useQmlImportPathEnvVar` setting.

## Language Server
The QML language has an associated language server,
[qmlls](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtqml-tooling-qmlls.html).
We recommend using it, as it will catch a lot of bad practice that may
make your configuration harder to maintain later.

We are aware of the following issues:
- Qmlls does not work well when a file is not correctly structured.
  This means that completions and lints won't work unless braces are closed
  correctly and such.
- Qmlls cannot handle Quickshell's Singleton, which means you won't see completions,
  and usages of Singleton members may show a warning. We're still investigating
  this problem and how to fix it.
- The LSP cannot provide any documentation for Quickshell types.

Keeping in mind the above caveats, qmlls should be able to guide you towards a
more correct code should you choose to use it.

> [!NOTE]
> Nix users should note that qmlls will not be able to pick up qml modules
> that are not in `QML2_IMPORT_PATH`. The easiest way to ensure this is by setting
> `qt.enable` to `true` and installing the quickshell package globally.
