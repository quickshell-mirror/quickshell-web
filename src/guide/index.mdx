See the [Installation and Setup](/docs/guide/install-setup) page to get started.

To write a Quickshell config, start by following the
[Guided Introduction](/docs/guide/introduction), and skimming the
[QML Language Overview](/docs/guide/qml-language).

After that, read the [Item Size and Position](/docs/guide/size-position) page before
continuing on your own to learn how to lay out elements in QML. Laying out elements
in QML is significantly different from many other layout systems such as CSS.

To learn what features Quickshell offers and how to use them, use the
left sidebar and click through the `Quickshell Types` pages. The sidebar
also links QtQuick's type index, which contains most of the visual elements used
to build a UI.

You may also want to check out the [Official Examples] to see some code,
as well as review existing user configs. Do note that Quickshell has evolved
considerably over time and most configs don't reflect current best practice.
