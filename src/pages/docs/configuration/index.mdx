See [Getting Started](./configuration/getting-started) for installation and editor configuration instructions.

You should start with the [Introduction](./configuration/intro) which will guide you
through the basics of QML by creating a simple topbar with a clock.

From there you can read the [QML Overview](./configuration/qml-overview) to get an overview of
the QML language, or jump right into the [Type Reference](/docs/types) to find
types you can use in your shell.

The [quickshell-examples](https://git.outfoxxed.me/outfoxxed/quickshell-examples) repo contains
fully working example configurations you can read and modify.
